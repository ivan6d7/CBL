## Overview
It's a classis Minesweeper with 4 levels, each generating randomly. Each level contains mines, empty cells and special item cells. There are 3 items in total: Health potion, Reveal potion and Defuse Kit.
Health potion increases health by 1, Reeal potion reveals positions of all cells for 1 second, Defuse Kit defuses 1 random mine.
On the bottom of the frame there is a user panel, which holds run info: current level, amount of lives and ration of flags set by player/number of mines on the level.
Player can click cells to reveal them with left click, set flags on where they suspect the mine to be and use potion if they have them.
